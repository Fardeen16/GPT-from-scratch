**Nano Chat-GPT: A Miniature Implementation of GPT for Shakespearean Text Generation**

This project focuses on designing and training a simplified version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch, capable of generating Shakespeare-like plays. It explores foundational concepts of transformer architecture and machine learning in a practical and illustrative way.

**Key Features**<br />
  Transformer Architecture:
  Developed core components of the transformer architecture using PyTorch, including self-attention, multi-head attention, and feedforward layers. These elements enable the model to 
  effectively capture relationships and dependencies within sequential text data.
  
  Token and Positional Embedding:
  Implemented a robust token embedding system to represent individual characters and words while integrating positional embeddings to retain sequential and contextual information. This     
  combination allows the model to understand text structure and context simultaneously.
  
  Training Optimization:
  Trained the model on text-based datasets using the AdamW optimizer. The training process included hyperparameter tuning for factors such as learning rate and batch size to achieve 
  convergence and enhance the quality of generated text. The result was improved performance in producing cohesive and stylistically accurate Shakespearean text.

**Key Learnings**<br />
This project highlights the practical challenges and benefits of working with foundational deep learning architectures. By creating a fully functional mini-GPT model, it demonstrates the capabilities of transformers in understanding language patterns and context for text generation tasks.
